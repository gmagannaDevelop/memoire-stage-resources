abstract = {The construction of models of biological networks from prior knowledge and experimental data often leads to a multitude of candidate models. Devising a single model from them can require arbitrary choices, which may lead to strong biases in subsequent predictions. We introduce here a methodology for a) synthesizing Boolean model ensembles satisfying a set of biologically relevant constraints and b) reasoning on the dynamics of the ensembles of models. The synthesis is performed using Answer-Set Programming, extending prior work to account for solution diversity and universal constraints on reachable fixed points, enabling an accurate specification of desired dynamics. The sampled models are then simulated and the results are aggregated through averaging or can be analyzed as a multi-dimensional distribution. We illustrate our approach on a previously published Boolean model of a molecular network regulating the cell fate decisions in cancer progression. It appears that the ensemble-based approach to Boolean modelling brings new insights on the variability of synergistic interacting mutations effect concerning propensity of a cancer cell to metastasize.},

abstract = {State space methods are one of the most important approaches to computer-aided analysis and verification of the behaviour of concurrent systems. In their basic form, they consist of enumerating and analysing the set of the states the system can ever reach. Unfortunately, the number of states of even a relatively small system is often far greater than can be handled in a realistic computer. The goal of this article is to analyse this state explosion problem from several perspectives. Many advanced state space methods alleviate the problem by using a subset or an abstraction of the set of states. Unfortunately, their use tends to restrict the set of analysis or verification questions that can be answered, making it impossible to discuss the methods without some taxonomy of the questions. Therefore, the article contains a lengthy discussion on alternative ways of stating analysis and verification questions, and algorithms for answering them. After that, many advanced state space methods are briefly described. The state explosion problem is investigated also from the computational complexity point of view.},

@article{Jung2017,
abstract = {Motivation: The identification of genes or molecular regulatory mechanisms implicated in biological processes often requires the discretization, and in particular booleanization, of gene expression measurements. However, currently used methods mostly classify each measurement into an active or inactive state regardless of its statistical support possibly leading to downstream analysis conclusions based on spurious booleanization results. Results: In order to overcome the lack of certainty inherent in current methodologies and to improve the process of discretization, we introduce RefBool, a reference-based algorithm for discretizing gene expression data. Instead of requiring each measurement to be classified as active or inactive, RefBool allows for the classification of a third state that can be interpreted as an intermediate expression of genes. Furthermore, each measurement is associated to a p- A nd q-value indicating the significance of each classification. Validation of RefBool on a neuroepithelial differentiation study and subsequent qualitative and quantitative comparison against 10 currently used methods supports its advantages and shows clear improvements of resulting clusterings. Availability and Implementation: The software is available as MATLAB files in the Supplementary Information and as an online repository (https://github.com/saschajung/RefBool).},

abstract = {Predicting biological systems' behaviors requires taking into account many molecular and genetic elements for which limited information is available past a global knowledge of their pairwise interactions. Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks.},

abstract = {Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.},

abstract = {Although molecular prognostics in breast cancer are among the most successful examples of translating genomic analysis to clinical applications, optimal approaches to breast cancer clinical risk prediction remain controversial. The Sage Bionetworks-DREAM Breast Cancer Prognosis Challenge (BCC) is a crowdsourced research study for breast cancer prognostic modeling using genome-scale data. The BCC provided a community of data analysts with a common platform for data access and blinded evaluation of model accuracy in predicting breast cancer survival on the basis of gene expression data, copy number data, and clinical covariates. This approach offered the opportunity to assess whether a crowdsourced community Challenge would generate models of breast cancer prognosis commensurate with or exceeding current best-in-class approaches. The BCC comprised multiple rounds of blinded evaluations on held-out portions of data on 1981 patients, resulting in more than 1400 models submitted as open source code. Participants then retrained their models on the full data set of 1981 samples and submitted up to five models for validation in a newly generated data set of 184 breast cancer patients. Analysis of the BCC results suggests that the best-performing modeling strategy outperformed previously reported methods in blinded evaluations; model performance was consistent across several independent evaluations; and aggregating community-developed models achieved performance on par with the best-performing individual models.

For this reason, the development of new methods for handling scRNA-seq count data is currently one of the most active research fields in bioinformatics. To help the development of such new methods, the availability of simulated data could play a pivotal role. However, only few scRNA-seq count data simulators are available, often showing poor or not demonstrated similarity with real data. Results: In this article we present SPARSim, a scRNA-seq count data simulator based on a Gamma-Multivariate Hypergeometric model. We demonstrate that SPARSim allows to generate count data that resemble real data in terms of count intensity, variability and sparsity, performing comparably or better than one of the most used scRNA-seq simulator, Splat. In particular, SPARSim simulated count matrices well resemble the distribution of zeros across different expression intensities observed in real count data.},

abstract = {To use next-generation sequencing technology such as RNA-seq for medical and health applications, choosing proper analysis methods for biomarker identification remains a critical challenge for most users. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has led the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) project to conduct a comprehensive investigation of 278 representative RNA-seq data analysis pipelines consisting of 13 sequence mapping, three quantification, and seven normalization methods. In this article, we focused on the impact of the joint effects of RNA-seq pipelines on gene expression estimation as well as the downstream prediction of disease outcomes. First, we developed and applied three metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, and reliability) to quantitatively evaluate each pipeline's performance on gene expression estimation. We then investigated the correlation between the proposed metrics and the downstream prediction performance using two real-world cancer datasets (i.e., SEQC neuroblastoma dataset and the NIH/NCI TCGA lung adenocarcinoma dataset). We found that RNA-seq pipeline components jointly and significantly impacted the accuracy of gene expression estimation, and its impact was extended to the downstream prediction of these cancer outcomes. Specifically, RNA-seq pipelines that produced more accurate, precise, and reliable gene expression estimation tended to perform better in the prediction of disease outcome. In the end, we provided scenarios as guidelines for users to use these three metrics to select sensible RNA-seq pipelines for the improved accuracy, precision, and reliability of gene expression estimation, which lead to the improved downstream gene expression-based prediction of disease outcome.},

We present here a novel framework, referred to as PROFILE, to tailor logical models to a particular biological sample such as a patient tumor. This methodology permits to compare the model simulations to individual clinical data, i.e., survival time. Our approach focuses on integrating mutation data, copy number alterations (CNA), and expression data (transcriptomics or proteomics) to logical models.

abstract = {Background: The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has led to the emergence of many methods for removing systematic technical noises, including imputation methods, which aim to address the increased sparsity observed in single-cell data. Although many imputation methods have been developed, there is no consensus on how methods compare to each other. Results: Here, we perform a systematic evaluation of 18 scRNA-seq imputation methods to assess their accuracy and usability. We benchmark these methods in terms of the similarity between imputed cell profiles and bulk samples and whether these methods recover relevant biological signals or introduce spurious noise in downstream differential expression, unsupervised clustering, and pseudotemporal trajectory analyses, as well as their computational run time, memory usage, and scalability. Methods are evaluated using data from both cell lines and tissues and from both plate- and droplet-based single-cell platforms. Conclusions: We found that the majority of scRNA-seq imputation methods outperformed no imputation in recovering gene expression observed in bulk RNA-seq. However, the majority of the methods did not improve performance in downstream analyses compared to no imputation, in particular for clustering and trajectory analysis, and thus should be used with caution. In addition, we found substantial variability in the performance of the methods within each evaluation aspect. Overall, MAGIC, kNN-smoothing, and SAVER were found to outperform the other methods most consistently.},

We further demonstrate its utility for understanding myoblast differentiation and disentangling known heterogeneity in hematopoiesis for different organisms. STREAM is an open-source software package.},

abstract = {Â  Single-cell RNA-seq technologies have been successfully employed over the past decade to generate many high resolution cell atlases. These have proved invaluable in recent efforts aimed at understanding the cell type specificity of host genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 infections. While single-cell atlases are based on well-sampled highly-expressed genes, many of the genes of interest for understanding SARS-CoV-2 can be expressed at very low levels. Common assumptions underlying standard single-cell analyses don't hold when examining low-expressed genes, with the result that standard workflows can produce misleading results.

abstract = {This article is part of a comprehensive research project on liquidity risk in asset management, which can be divided into three dimensions. The first dimension covers liability liquidity risk (or funding liquidity) modeling, the second dimension focuses on asset liquidity risk (or market liquidity) modeling, and the third dimension considers asset-liability liquidity risk management (or asset-liability matching). The purpose of this research is to propose a methodological and practical framework in order to perform liquidity stress testing programs, which comply with regulatory guidelines (ESMA, 2019) and are useful for fund managers. The review of the academic literature and professional research studies shows that there is a lack of standardized and analytical models. The aim of this research project is then to fill the gap with the goal to develop mathematical and statistical approaches, and provide appropriate answers. In this first part that focuses on liability liquidity risk modeling, we propose several statistical models for estimating redemption shocks. The historical approach must be complemented by an analytical approach based on zero-inflated models if we want to understand the true parameters that influence the redemption shocks. Moreover, we must also distinguish aggregate population models and individual-based models if we want to develop behavioral approaches. Once these different statistical models are calibrated, the second big issue is the risk measure to assess normal and stressed redemption shocks. Finally, the last issue is to develop a factor model that can translate stress scenarios on market risk factors into stress scenarios on fund liabilities.},

@article{Tang2020,
abstract = {Motivation: Normalization of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is a prerequisite to their interpretation. The marked technical variability, high amounts of missing observations and batch effect typical of scRNA-seq datasets make this task particularly challenging. There is a need for an efficient and unified approach for normalization, imputation and batch effect correction. Results: Here, we introduce bayNorm, a novel Bayesian approach for scaling and inference of scRNA-seq counts. The method's likelihood function follows a binomial model of mRNA capture, while priors are estimated from expression values across cells using an empirical Bayes approach. We first validate our assumptions by showing this model can reproduce different statistics observed in real scRNA-seq data. We demonstrate using publicly available scRNA-seq datasets and simulated expression data that bayNorm allows robust imputation of missing values generating realistic transcript distributions that match single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization measurements. Moreover, by using priors informed by dataset structures, bayNorm improves accuracy and sensitivity of differential expression analysis and reduces batch effect compared with other existing methods. Altogether, bayNorm provides an efficient, integrated solution for global scaling normalization, imputation and true count recovery of gene expression measurements from scRNA-seq data. Availability and implementation: The R package 'bayNorm' is publishd on bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/bayNorm.html. The code for analyzing data in this article is available at https://github. com/WT215/bayNorm_papercode.},

@article{Clivio2019,
abstract = {In single-cell RNA sequencing data, biological processes or technical factors may induce an overabundance of zero measurements. Existing probabilistic approaches to interpreting these data either model all genes as zero-inflated, or none. But the overabundance of zeros might be gene-specific. Hence, we propose the AutoZI model, which, for each gene, places a spike-and-slab prior on a mixture assignment between a negative binomial (NB) component and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) component. We approximate the posterior distribution under this model using variational inference, and employ Bayesian decision theory to decide whether each gene is zero-inflated. On simulated data, AutoZI outperforms the alternatives. On negative control data, AutoZI retrieves predictions consistent to a previous study on ERCC spike-ins and recovers similar results on control RNAs. Applied to several datasets and instances of the 10x Chromium protocol, AutoZI allows both biological and technical interpretations of zero-inflation. Finally, AutoZI's decisions on mouse embyronic stem-cells suggest that zero-inflation might be due to transcriptional bursting.},
